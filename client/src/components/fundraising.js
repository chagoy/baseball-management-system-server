			<h3>Fundraising</h3>
				<p className='fundraiser-text'>We are an all-volunteer organization that relies on parental participation to carry on the routine duties of the League. Registration fees cover only a portion of the cost of league operation. Parents are asked to participate in fundraising activities during the season. Your support will allow us to improve the quality of our program while at the same time holding down the cost of registration.  Parent participation is the key to MPKâ€™s success.</p>
				<p>I understand that as a member of this league, I am committed to purchasing 3 Dodger tickets for the annual fundraiser (plus 1 additional ticket for each additional child).</p>
