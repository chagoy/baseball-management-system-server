			<p>GUIDELINES FOR BEHAVIOR</p>
			<p>It is the objective of the MPK Baseball and Softball, Inc. to provide your kids with a fun atmosphere in which to engage in healthy athletic competition. Our goals are to introduce the kids to the game of baseball and meet other kids and families, building lifelong relationships while enjoying the game of baseball. Because of the excitement and high emotion during our games, it is important to understand some guidelines regarding what is expected of you, your family members and your children. We encourage cheering, excitement, and competitiveness, but letâ€™s give both sides the same encouragement for positive reinforcement.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We will not tolerate any behavior on the playing field or in the stands that would hinder the spirit of sportsmanship and cooperation that we are trying to encourage.
				</li>
				<li>
					The umpire is in charge of all game rules and regulations on and off the field. Please give the umpire proper respect. The Managers of the teams playing are the only ones allowed to dispute a call.
				</li>
				<li>
					At no time will we permit abusive behavior, abusive language or profanity.
				</li>
				<li>
					Alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the vicinity of any of the playing fields or where otherwise prohibited.
				</li>
				<li>
					A No Smoking policy is enforced on the park premises.
				</li>
				<li>
					Conduct of guests is the responsibility of the adult whose child participates in the League. Games can be forfeited due to behavior of the spectators.
				</li>
				<li>
					This is a volunteer program. We expect that you will do your part to keep the facilities clean and litter free.
				</li>
				<li>
					Failure to comply with these rules may result in the player, parent or guest being asked to leave the premises, and could result in forfeiture of the game. Serious or repeated offenses could result in expulsion from the League.
				</li>
			</ul>
