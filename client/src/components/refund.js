			<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
			<p>Our goal with refunds is to be flexible and fair. We will respond to any reasonable situation that arises. All we ask is that you understand the Leagueâ€™s need to have a time frame wherein we can fairly respond. In particular, once teams have been formed, refunds will not be issued barring unusual and unforeseeable circumstances. Withdrawing a player after teams are formed can adversely affect a team and the entire Division. Accordingly, the MPK refund policy is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prior to tryouts: 100% refund</li>
				<li>Prior to opening ceremonies: 50% refund</li>
				<li>After opening ceremonies: No refund</li>
			</ul>
